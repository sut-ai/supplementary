    "Convex Optimization is a subfield of mathematical optimization that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. Many methods are classified as convex optimization.\n",
    "Although it is instrumental in Artificial Intelligence, Convex Optimization is a general technique that does not limit to Artificial Intelligence and has applications in various fields, such as information and communication systems, circuit design, portfolio optimization (stock exchange), and many others more.\n",
    "This Notebook will cover the fundamental theoretical concepts and optimization and convex optimization and show some simple Python examples to learn how to use this technique.\n",

    "Mathematical optimization is selecting the best element, subject to some criterion from a set of available alternatives. It must be noted that the word Optimization is used in many different contexts. For example, we have Compiler Optimization in programming language implementation and compiler theory, which is very different from what we will talk about. In this notebook, whenever you see optimization, it means \"Mathematical Optimization.\" \n",

    "Many definitions try to formalize the definition of Mathematical Optimization. Here, we present one of the most used notations.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are various variations of these notations, but they can easily be transformed to the one presented above. For example the problem of maximizing function $f_0(x)$ could easily be transformed into the problem of minimizing function $-f_o(x)$.\n",

    "There are two aspects in optimization problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding good models\n",
    "- Solving the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these two aspects is as important as the other one. If you don't have a good model, solving it will not help you solve the real-world problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is a mapping from the real-world high-level description of the problem to the mathematical notations. For example, in circuit design problems, x can represent the specifications of the actual design, like the placement of each component and other technical information. Constraints come from the physical limitations of the manufacturing process and performance requirements, and last, but not least, the objective function can be a combination of cost, weight, power, area, etc. We should define all of these aspects mathematically in order to have a good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple methods to solve the problem. Convex Optimization focuses on methods of solving specific but prevalent types of optimization problems. More on that later."
