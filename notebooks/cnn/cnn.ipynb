    "CNNs are a type of deep learning models are being used a lot in today's world, especially regarding computer vision applications. They can help users in a wide range of possibilities, from recognizing faces and emotions, helping the medical doctors in healthcare settings, aiding students in their education, supporting self-checkout in retail stores, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to their popularity, it seems to be a necessity to learn about how they work and how can we train one using libraries which are now commonplace among researchers and students.\n",

    "The structure of this notebook is as follows: first, an introduction to CNN is given, then the concept of convolution is described in further details. Afterwards, a CNN model has been trained step-by-step using TensorFlow - a popular framework for ML and vision related activities. Finally, after concluding what we've learned, links are provided for further reading in case you, as a reader, are interested. We assume you know about deep learning and multi-layered ANNs before you start reading this notebook.\n",

    "## Introduction: What is a CNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, there are various types of multi-layered artificial neural networks (also called ANNs) available. Specifically, one type of them are called \"convolutional neural networks\" - or CNNs - which are mostly used in the field of computer vision. They are able to find (or \"extract\") many features of the images given to them as the training data, and then classify the test dataset by inspecting them for the extracted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical representation of an image\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that computers can't see an \"image\" as we do; instead, all computer programs work with numbers and digits. As a result, we - as the users of a CNN - should also give it the images we have in a numerical format, or else it won't understand a bit about the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't need to implement some fancy algorithm to be able to convert an image to a numerical format used by CNNs, because the numbers are already there in format of pixel values. Each pixel is assigned a value in a picture, which are rendered together on a computer screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with this approach is the number of pixels in a picture. An example 128*128 image - which is considered so small in modern measurements - contains 16384 pixels which are usually a lot for a model to find features in. To fix this problem which is common in pre-CNN networks, some new concepts are used in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue our discussion onto how the CNNs work, first we should know the concept of convolution. If you know what a convolution is, you may skip the section in which the concept of conclusion and its relation to convolutional neural networks are covered and discussed.\n"
   ]

    "## What is a convolution and how do CNNs work?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned till now, we need a way to somehow select the important features in an image while training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have possibly seen \"filters\" in the camera app in your smartphone. Many of these filters focus on special parts of your image; as an example, filters such as the \"Stage Light\" filter in the Camera app in iOS only focuses on your face and blurs the background while taking a pictures. We want to use a similar idea to find features in images here, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about CNNs, the filters are usually called \"kernels\". They are a special kind of matrix (usually 3*3) which is \"convoluted\" with the matrix of all pixels of the original image. The result of the \"convolution\" process - which is a mathematical operation - is known as a \"feature map\" or \"activation map\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The details on how the \"convolution\" is calculated is not necessarily needed in order to understand how to train a CNN using Tensorflow, but an overview is given here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operartion works as follows: the kernel will slide over the matrix of the image and an \"element-wise\" multiplication will happen at every stage. The results of the element-wise multiplication are added together and stored in one pixel of the output matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is being presented in the animation below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Convolution Example](convolution-example.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a convolution is performed, a matrix is transformed into some another matrix. Calculating the weighted some of neighboring cells allows us to only see the input features coming from \"about the same\" location, instead of exact parameters, which will decrease the number of parameters the model has to train on, to a great extend and as a result, the model can do more iterations or calculations in the same time, possibly leading to a better accuracy on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other steps before giving data to the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the basics of convolution, let's discuss a bit more about CNNs in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the convolution result (feature map) is obtained, we apply a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to make the operation non-linear (as we did in many cases in ANNs). Then, we can use \"pooling\", another technique in CNNs which ensures the network can find features independent from their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "A famous type of pooling is called \"max pooling\" in which the largest value in 2*2 boxes over the picture are selected, as can be inspected in this picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Max Pooling Example](pooling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This action will keep the main features while the size of picture is decreased, so possibly there would be less overfitting when the model is being trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "After pooling is performed on a picture, the matrix is ready to be flattened into a single vector which is able to help the model train.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Many architectures regarding CNNs have been previously tried and tested, such as MobileNet, Xception, etc. They have been trained on a dataset of more than a million images, so they include weights in advance which can be used or not (we may use the trained model, or we may only use the architecture and train it again on our own data). Designing a new architecture is also obviously possible.\n"
