    "Prolog is a **logic programming** language. It means that it is different in nature from the general-purpose form of languages like C++, Java, Python, Javascript, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog is based on [First-Order Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic) and is purely designed as a [declarative programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). The logic is expressed in terms of relations, and all the computation is initiated by queries.\n",

    "- Do I get a job by solely learning Prolog? The answer is probably not. Prolog is not a general-purpose language and is currently used only in specific fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does learning Prolog change your overall programming skill? Absolutely Yes. It uses a different paradigm than famous languages and teaches you how to tackle problems differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does learning prolog help you get a better position in a company? That depends on the type of company. Suppose the company is related to Artificial Intelligence. In that case, your way of logical thinking that you get by learning Prolog and even the Prolog can help you be promoted to a better position.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other reasons why to learn Prolog, read [this article](http://dstrohmaier.com/why-learn-prolog-in-2021/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a summary, I selected this sentence from the aforementioned article:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"As a student of computer science [engineering], one can make a decent career by always following the hype, but to stand out, one has to diverge from the well-trodden paths. Those willing to explore unpopular territory have a chance of being ahead of the crowd.\""
