    "- Do I get a job by solely learning Prolog? The answer is probably not. Prolog is not a general-purpose language and is currently used only in specific fields.\n",

    "- Does learning prolog help you get a better position in a company? That depends on the type of company. Suppose the company is related to Artificial Intelligence. In that case, your way of logical thinking that you get by learning Prolog and even the Prolog can help you be promoted to a better position.\n",
