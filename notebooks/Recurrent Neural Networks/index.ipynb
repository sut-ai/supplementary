    "Traditional feed-forward neural networks take in a fixed amount of input data all at the same time and produce a fixed amount of output each time. However, in some context in machine learning we want to have more flexibility in the types of data that our model can process. therefore, we move to this idea of recurrent neural networks (RNN). A recurrent neural network is a special type of an artificial neural network adapted to work for time series data or data that involves sequences; Meaning, RNNs do not consume all the input data at once. Instead, they take them in one at a time and in a sequence. At each step, the RNN does a series of calculations before producing an output. The output, known as the hidden state, is then combined with the next input in the sequence to produce another output. This process continues until the model is programmed to finish or the input sequence ends. To sum up, RNNs have the concept of memory that helps them store the states or information of previous inputs to generate the next output of the sequence.\n",

    "We can think about RNNs in two ways. one is this concept of having a hidden state that feeds back at itself recurrently. The other one is to think about unrolling this computational graph for multiple time steps. This would help understanding the recurrent network easier.\n",
